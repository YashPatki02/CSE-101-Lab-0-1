## Me as a Programmer:

Over the years, I have become a lot better at ~~procrastinating~~ coding. 

Personally, my current favorite language to use is Python. If you want to learn it, refer to [this](https://docs.python.org/3/ "Solution to your problems!").

The reason why I love Python is

```python
    print("Hello World!)
```

That's all you need to print a line. You don't need

```java
    System.out.println("Hello World");
````

or 

```c++
    cout << "Hello World";
```

We want to print "Hello World,"so we simply call the **print()** method!.

#### My Goals as a Programmer:


* [ ] Secure an internship
* [ ] Work on a cool new project
* [ ] Do well in CSE 110
* [x] ~~No need for a fourth thing once again.~~
